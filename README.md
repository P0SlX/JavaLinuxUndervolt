## What is it?

This is a small gui created in Java for the undervolt.py script written by georgewhewell [here](https://github.com/georgewhewell/undervolt)

## What can I do with it? 

You can set each value core, gpu, cache, uncore, analogio (temperature target on my pc does not work, so I haven't implemented it). 
You can also save your profile.
